<h1 style="color : black">Eminem's Family </h1>

<h3 style="color :orange">Eminem has been scrutinized, as a rapper and personally. The rapper was married twice to Kimberly Anne "Kim" Scott. He met Kim in high school; he was 15 and she was 13 when he stood on a table with his shirt off rapping LL Cool J's "I'm Bad". Kim and her twin sister Dawn had run away from home; they moved in with Eminem and his mother when he was 15, and he began an on-and-off relationship with Kim in 1989. Their daughter Hailie was born on December 25, 1995; they married in 1999, divorcing in 2001. Although Eminem told Rolling Stone in 2002, "I would rather have a baby through my penis than get married again", he and Kim briefly remarried in January 2006. He filed for divorce in early April, agreeing to joint custody of Hailie. He also has custody of Dawn's daughter Alaina and Whitney, Kim's daughter from another relationship.In early 2010, Eminem denied tabloid reports that he and Kim had reconciled. He had legal custody of his younger half-brother Nathan, who is a rapper known by his stage name "Nate Kane". In his 2014 song "Headlights", Eminem apologized to, and reiterated his love for, his mother.
